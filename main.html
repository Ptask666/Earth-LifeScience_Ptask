    <p>Hydrometeorology is the interdisciplinary study of the atmospheric and hydrological processes that govern the distribution and movement of water in the atmosphere and on the Earth's surface. It encompasses a wide range of topics including weather patterns, climate change, the hydrological cycle, water resources management, floods and droughts, and meteorological data analysis.</p>
   <p> Hydrometeorology aims at measuring and understanding the physics, chemistry, energy and water fluxes of the atmosphere, and their coupling with the earth surface environmental parameters. Accurate hydrometeorological records and observations with different timelines are crucial to assess climate evolution and weather forecast. Historical records suggest that the first hydrometeorological observations date back to ca 3500 BC. Reviewing these observations in the light of our modern knowledge of the dynamic of atmospheres is critical as it can reduce the ambiguities associated to understanding major fluctuations or evolutions in the earth climate. Today, the ambiguities in hydrometeorological observations have significantly improved due to the advances in monitoring, modeling, and forecasting of processes related to the land-atmosphere coupling and forcing. Numerical models have been developed to forecast hydrometeorological phenomena in short-, medium- and long-term horizons, ranging from hourly to annual timescales. We provide herein a synthetic review of advances in hydrometeorological observations from their infancy to today. In particular, we discuss the role of hydrometeorological records, observations, and modeling in assessing the amplitude and time-scale for climate change and global warming.</p>
    <p>Hydrometeorological records started in ca 3000 BC mainly by observing the movement of moon and stars. Since then, our understanding of hydrometeorology has advanced considerably, especially with the significant growth of technology in the second half of the 20th century (e.g., introduction of televisions in the early 1950s and computers in the 1970s).</p>
    <p>One of the more significant aspects of hydrometeorology involves predictions about and attempts to mitigate the effects of high precipitation events.[4] There are three primary ways to model meteorological phenomena in weather forecasting, including nowcasting, numerical weather prediction, and statistical techniques.[2] Nowcasting is good for predicting events a few hours out, utilizing observations and live radar data to combine them with numerical weather prediction models.[2] The primary technique used to forecast weather, numerical weather prediction uses mathematical models to account for the atmosphere, ocean, and many other variables when producing forecasts.[2] These forecasts are generally used to predict events days or weeks out.[2] Finally, statistical techniques use regressions and other statistical methods to create long-term projections that go out weeks and months at a time.[2] These models allow scientists to visualize how a multitude of different variables interact with one another, and they illustrate one grand picture of how the Earth's climate interacts with itself.[5]</p>
